README

Thank you for buying the Asset.

How to use:

- Just drag the wanted models from the proper '_Prefabs' project dir to the Hierarchy.

- Accessories, slat armor are within the same prefab; just delete the parts you don't need!

- For optimization it is suggested to attach the meshes with shared materials.

- LOD stages in the prefabs are under the 'HI' meshes with switched off Mesh renderers. Use the LOD system you prefer!

- Feel free to edit the textures with the help of the included Texture Sources (attached to 'MEDIA SOURCE HOLDERS')!
